## About The Project

This is a website to search for movies on <a href='https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction'>themoviedb.org</a> and 
create a personalized list. This feature requires connecting to a firebase database. There is also a blog feature but the supporting database is no longer in service. (This tutorial assumes you have installed <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a>)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/benskee/React_Boilerplate.git
    ```

2. Install packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Activate React
    ```sh

    ```
